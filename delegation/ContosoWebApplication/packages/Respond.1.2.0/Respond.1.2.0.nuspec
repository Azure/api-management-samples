    <description>The goal of this script is to provide a fast and lightweight (3kb minified / 1kb gzipped) script to enable responsive web designs in browsers that don't support CSS3 Media Queries - in particular, Internet Explorer 8 and under. It's written in such a way that it will probably patch support for other non-supporting browsers as well (more information on that soon).</description>
    <summary>A fast &amp; lightweight polyfill for min/max-width CSS3 Media Queries (for IE 6-8, and more)</summary>
